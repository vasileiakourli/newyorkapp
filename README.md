Info: Using Java we implemented Map Reduce on a given set of Foursquare check-ins through a MySQL database. Getting the best of these locations, we created an Android application which for a given sub-map of NY (certain coordinates) and a given date, it runs Map Reduce and produces the locations on a Google Map or shows info and photographs for each of those locations.
